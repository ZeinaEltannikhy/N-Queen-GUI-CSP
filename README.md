# ♟️ 8-Queens Problem – GUI Solver (Python & Tkinter)

Hi! this is a simple GUI application I built to solve the classic **8-Queens Problem** using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This project helped me explore backtracking algorithms, constraint satisfaction, and basic GUI programming.

---

## 💡 What is the 8-Queens Problem?

The goal is to place 8 queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other—meaning no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Interactive chessboard GUI using **Tkinter**
- ♟️ Manual queen placement with cell disabling for attacked zones
- 🧠 Automated solver using **backtracking with forward checking**
- 🎲 Displays a random valid solution from all possibilities
- 🔁 Reset and re-run anytime during execution

---

## 🧪 How to Run It

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so no extra libraries are needed.
3. Run the script with:

```bash
python "8 queen project.py"

A window will appear where you can:

Click to manually place queens

Press the "Solve" button to automatically generate a valid configuration

🎯 Why I Built This
I wanted to challenge myself with a classic AI problem and visualize the solution process. Building this helped me understand:

How backtracking works

How to apply constraints visually

How to use Tkinter to build grid-based interfaces
